## Kubernetes 10th Year Time Capsule Project

This project is a time capsule created to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Kubernetes and immortalize this important milestone. We aim to create a memorial for those who have made significant contributions to the development and impact of Kubernetes, including users and community members.

## Phase-01
In the first phase, we aim to collect data via a website and form and store it securely via API. We will complete the first phase by May 1, 2024. We will then collect messages until the end of June 2024.
## Phase-02
After all the messages are collected (We plan to store the messages in an Object Storage), a classification process will begin and we will set up the capsule at the right time with a second API and a few JOBs that we will create. (Deadline August 1 2024)
## Phase-03
With the test data, we will determine how the messages will appear on the web and in the e-mails to be sent to users and make some developments. (Deadline September 1 2024)
## Phase-04
Wait for the Right Time!
